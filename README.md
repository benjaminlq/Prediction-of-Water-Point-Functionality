## Business Settings
The objective of this study is to build a predictive model to predict Non-Functional water points in Nigeria based on predictors such as water management records, population data, geographical location of the water points, etc. The prediction outcomes will help Nigerian government and private water supply companies in planning to rehabilitate Non-functional water points.
